There seems to be a fundamental misunderstanding between all teams and me. From what I gathered, you assume that the schema and data should be completely separate for each model and app. In my opinion, that's a big mistake. This approach can lead to fragmentation, duplication, and a lack of consistency across the system. I believe a shared, well-structured schema with centralized data is crucial for scalability, maintainability, and efficiency.
From my side, I’ve been consistently pushing for a more unified approach.

I, Mahmoud, have been putting a lot of thought and effort into building a system that supports consistent data, easy extensibility, and the ability to label and extract information effectively. My suggestions have always been guided by that goal. I truly believe that having a shared schema and centralized data is key to building something scalable and maintainable.

That’s why, as a first step, I’m focusing on collecting the data and refining its structure—so everything that follows is built on a solid, consistent foundation.

But I feel like we keep looping, and each time you ask for something new or point out a new issue. From my perspective, many of these problems are a result of the current approach being followed. I just want to make sure we’re aligned so we don’t keep running into the same roadblocks.
