## This Project For:

### ðŸ”§ **Developers & Data Engineers**

**TurathLLM** is an open-source pipeline that transforms unstructured Islamic heritage texts into structured SQL databases. It uses regex, lightweight AI models, and data-cleaning tools to parse classical books, extract metadata, and build review-ready datasets. Ideal for devs building tools around knowledge graphs, search systems, or scholarly annotation platforms.

### ðŸ“Š **Data Scientists & NLP Folks**

**TurathLLM** is a hybrid rule-based + AI pipeline that turns classical Islamic texts into structured data. Designed for Arabic NLP tasks, it combines regex-driven tagging with small LLMs to extract entities, relationships, and schema-ready metadata from complex heritage content. Itâ€™s a starting point for downstream tasks like NER, chain validation, and scholarly review support.

### ðŸ“š **Islamic Scholars & Researchers**

**TurathLLM** is a tool that helps prepare classical Islamic texts for scholarly review. It collects and organizes raw book content, then labels and structures the data â€” including narrators, chains, references, and metadata â€” using AI and rules. The result is a searchable, structured format that simplifies the task of verifying, analyzing, and studying traditional knowledge.


## ðŸ“¢ **Ethical Note on Data Sources** 
Iâ€™m collecting Islamic texts and datasets from various public and community sources. These materials were compiled by individuals and institutions who invested significant time, effort, and dedication. Some of this data may be subject to copyright or specific usage rights. This project is meant to support **scholars, developers, and researchers** who want to explore how Islamic and Arabic texts can be integrated with modern technologies â€” an area that remains underdeveloped and often lacks proper documentation or tools. 

> This is a humble attempt to **bring fragmented efforts together**, to offer a structured starting point for others, and to preserve the spirit of contribution while respecting the work of those who came before.

### If you use this data or build upon this project: 
* ðŸ§¾ **Please cite and reference original sources where applicable**
* ðŸ›‘ **Always verify copyright terms before any commercial use**
* ðŸ¤² This effort is for the sake of knowledge, and we seek **Allahâ€™s forgiveness** for any unintended misuse or oversight in crediting others.
