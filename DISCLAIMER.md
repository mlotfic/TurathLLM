# 📢 Disclaimer & Ethical Notice

This project includes data and content collected from various public and community sources, including classical Islamic books, digitized texts, and open datasets. Many of these materials were compiled by individuals and institutions who have put years of effort into preserving and making them available.

## 🧠 Purpose of This Project

The aim is to support scholars, developers, and researchers who want to apply modern technologies — such as natural language processing, information extraction, and AI — to Islamic and Arabic textual heritage. This field remains largely underexplored, and this project is a small step toward bridging the gap.

It is not a finished or polished dataset — but a **starting point** to build better tools, references, and datasets.

## ⚠️ Usage Guidelines

- 🔗 Always **cite and credit** original compilers, sources, and organizations where applicable.
- 📜 Check each dataset or text for **copyright or usage restrictions**, especially before **any commercial use**.
- 🛠️ If you're unsure about licensing, err on the side of caution and attribution.

## 🤲 Final Note

This project is done sincerely for the sake of knowledge and benefiting the Ummah. We seek Allah’s forgiveness for any shortcomings or mistakes, especially if we failed to properly credit someone’s work. If you believe your work has been included without proper attribution or against your will, please contact us, and we’ll take immediate action.

May Allah reward everyone who contributed to preserving and transmitting Islamic knowledge. Ameen.
